<h4>Introduction to COVID-19</h4>
<p>The life of Tim Berners-Lee is one that few people know about.  He is the scientist and inventor who was in the right place at the right time&mdash;at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland in the 1980s&mdash;to both 
invent the basic technologies and shape the culture that served as the seed crystal for the Internet as we know it today.  Other than the researcher's salary that he was receiving at the time, he never asked for any money for his
inventions, nor did he patent any of them.  Instead, he shared them so others could improve on his work, and as a result the Internet has evolved into what it is today.  We all know who Bill Gates is and we also know what Steve Jobs 
gave us; they produced the software and personal computers that we use to connect to the <a href="glossary.html#link9">Internet</a>. However, they did not "invent" the Internet.</p> 


<p class="block" style="position:relative; top:20px;"><a href="inventor.html">Inventor</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML; URIs, which eventually became URLs; browsers; the first server; and HTTP protocols; but he had a problem with patents.</p>
