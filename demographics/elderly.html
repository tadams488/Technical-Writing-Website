    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Effects on the Elderly</h4>
    <p>
        One of the groups most affected by the pandemic, physically and mentally, was the elderly population.  As the demographic most vulnerable to the virus initially, most of the mandates that were put in place were in an effort to protect these groups.  Nursing homes in particular went into extreme lockdowns, where family members and even spouses were unable to visit.  Despite these attempts, a wide majority of the deaths caused by Covid were in our elderly populations.  As shown in the graphic below, those aged 50 and older make up over 80 percent of the deaths related to Covid in Florida since the beginning of the pandemic, and those above 65 make up over half of total deaths.  This graphic was made using data from the Center for Disease Control Data Catalog regarding Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age, as seen in our works cited section.

    <p>
        As we see from the graph, the elderly were one of the groups most affected physically by the pandemic.  This in turn meant that they were most affected by the methods we had to stop the spread of Covid, such as lockdowns and other mandates put into place.  While Covid did not affect many of the younger people that contracted it in a way that would cause significant sickness or death, it did mean that the sickness could be spread to our more vulnerable populations, who were far more likely to die from Covid.  The elderly were certainly among those we sought to protect most with the mandates, but how did these mandates affect the elderly mentally?  The CDC, starting in May of 2020 and continuing until the present day, have released a Household Pulse Survey, which records many different trends in households during the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of these trends was incidents of symptoms of anxiety and depression as self-reported by households.  Below I have congregated the data from May 2020 to present on the trends of this specific survey in people aged 50 and above.  This data comes from the Indicators of Anxiety or Depression Based on Reported Frequency of Symptoms During Last 7 Days dataset as cited in our works cited section.

    </figure>

    <p>
	    While it does not include breakdowns on the individual age groups in the people above 50, this does show a general trend of the mental health states of elderly people during the pandemic and past the bulk of the lockdowns were done.  In the initial stages of the pandemic, scores for these age groups were high, as anxiety and depression were high amongst the population that was subjected to strict lockdowns and acute concerns around contracting Covid and the very real possibility of death if they did.  This trended down sharply into September before climbing to another plateau through to the start of 2021.  This may be due to the relaxing of restrictions, which gave an immediate respite before anxieties built again around the continued spread of Covid.  From there the graph spikes and dips, ending with a downward trend to today as we become more used to Covid, vaccines are widely available, and methods of protecting ourselves are more understood.  Overall, this further shows that the results of the lockdowns, while helping against the physical aspects of the pandemic worsened the mental aspects of the people being quarantined.
