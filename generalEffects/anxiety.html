      ...these two disorders are often comorbid, where they balance out the weaknesses of the other and end up making a perfect storm of destructive behavior.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to all the circumstances and situations we have outlined up to this point, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant increase in the cases of anxiety and depression among affected populations.  We will outline specific causes for anxiety and depression from all of the situations we have seen already in an effort to make it easier for people affected to identify issues and begin to address them.  While there are many reasons for anxiety and depressive disorders to manifest, these are some of the main reasons we have noticed that are directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and will therefore be the most likely catalysts for those suffering with these disorders during this time.  Isolation can often lead to depressive symptoms, and if left unchecked can lead to depressive disorders.  As isolation was one of the main ways the pandemic was mitigated early on, this became far more common very quickly in early 2020.  By contrast, anxiety disorders will be more associated with worries about the disease itself, as well as the constant uncertainty associated with the initial lack of knowledge surrounding the virus and the constantly changing policies designed to combat it.  Finally, these two disorders are often comorbid, where they balance out the weaknesses of the other and end up making a perfect storm of destructive behavior.  An answer to the depressive symptoms would be to become less isolated, which feeds the anxieties of physical interaction, and if anxieties are listened to, it could lead to more isolation and therefore more depressive mood, creating a counterweight effect between the depression and anxiety.

      ...they found that depression had a central role in prevalence not only on its own, but in the correlations with other terms measured in the study.    
    </p>
    <p>
      The isolation associated with the early Covid lockdown procedures may have led to a significant increase in cases of depressive disorders.  In a study done by Di Blasi et al. which used a node network to analyze the individual and connected effects of various forms of distress, they found that depression had a central role in prevalence not only on its own, but in the correlations with other terms measured in the study.  This relates to the comorbidity that will be discussed later.  Their study also watched for connections before and after lockdowns were lifted and found that depression was reduced in that network.  A theory that could be drawn from this is that depressive symptoms arise during lockdowns and contribute in part to anxiety and other mental issues as people are isolated and struggle to cope.  Then, as lockdowns are lifted, the depressive symptoms are decreased as isolation is reduced and more social outlets can be used to help individuals with feelings of loneliness and sadness, which also reduces the other facets of mental distress.  While this cannot be proven from one study alone, it can show that reducing isolation can reduce depressive symptoms in specifically lockdown situations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what happens when the individuals who suffer from anxiety disorders caused or exacerbated by the pandemic have to go through lockdown procedures?  Di Blasi et al. also covers these feelings in their models, with measures of anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty.  Intolerance of uncertainty is defined as “a dispositional characteristic referring to a difficulty in tolerating the negative affective state, triggered by a lack of information,” (Di Blasi et al., 2021, p.19).  Intolerance of uncertainty is essentially how much uncertainty, such as the constantly changing regulations or the unknown deadliness or transmissibility of Covid, will affect a person’s mental state.  From the initial lockdown to after lockdown models, intolerance of uncertainty showed a significant increase, meaning that as people transitioned back to in-person they felt more uncertain and this affected their mental health negatively and in a significant manner.  Uncertainty also showed a strong correlation with stress and anxiety, especially after lockdowns were lifted, which the researchers themselves theorize is due to uncertainty around the remittance of Covid and the regulations surrounding it.  Their research not only shows that anxieties were heightened during the time after lockdowns were removed, but that it was specifically uncertainty surrounding these events that contributed to it significantly.

    <p>
      Finally, the comorbidity between anxiety and depression plays a large role in the correlation between the two during the COVID-19 pandemic.  A more comprehensive definition of comorbidity can be found in the glossary of this report, but in essence the comorbidity between anxiety and depression means they are more likely to both be present in a person when the person develops one of the disorders, and that they can cause more intense distress when coupled together than the two disorders would be apart.  As we have already analyzed from the Di Blasi et al. study, we can see that there is credence to the idea that anxiety and depression, in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic, work to cover the weaknesses of the other disorder.  As depressive indicators in their model decreased as lockdowns ended, their indicators for anxiety and uncertainty showed significant increases.  During the lockdowns, depression was the core indicator of distress, with other signs of distress being linked strongly to depression.  Again, a single study cannot prove this, but it does lend credence to the idea that the ways to combat depressive symptoms are weak to anxieties around Covid, and assuaging these anxieties often led to more isolation and therefore depressive tendencies.  Now that we have identified some of the main reasons anxiety and depression manifested during the COVID-19 pandemic, we can look at methods of improving mental health that target these issues.
