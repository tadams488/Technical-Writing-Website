        During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was uncertain how the virus was spread, what its transmissibility was, how long it could live on surfaces, and how best to mitigate these issues.  Due to this uncertainty, many people opted to go all out on sanitization efforts.  This included the purchase of essentially all supplies of standard hand sanitizer almost immediately, and the subsequent production of homemade sanitizer or production of commercial sanitizers from other methods, such as alcohol distilleries.  Many hand sanitizers smelled of agave for this reason, as they were derived from the same locations that were previously making tequila.  Despite these alternate methods, hand sanitizer was almost always out of stock, in addition to most other cleaning and protective products.  Due to the increased demand of these products, price gouging, which is the process where sellers increase the prices of essential goods to many times the normal price, began occurring on sanitization products and personal protective equipment (PPE).  In a study by Cabral and Xu, the researchers found that many sellers began gouging prices up to 178% of prices compared to 2019, and references an extreme case of price gouging when “a 2 L bottle of Purell sold for as much as $250” (Cabral and Xu, 2021, p.869).  People then tended to hoard these supplies for the initial months of the pandemic, either grabbing them as soon as available out of a sense of scarcity, or from sensing a profit to be made.  Regardless of reason, the uncertainty surrounding these products led to many shortages, which only increased worries about people protecting themselves and their loved ones, causing even more anxiety and uncertainty around public spaces.

        While people worrying about the spread of germs is often a sign of germaphobia, we believe it is pertinent to differentiate that condition from what many people went through during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.  A more specific definition of germaphobia can be found in the glossary, but in essence it refers to an excessive or irrational fear of germs or disease.  In terms of fears surrounding COVID-19, many of these fears were reasonable, or at least not completely irrational.  The difference between extreme fear of Covid and extreme fear of germs in general is subtle, and both manifest similarly to anxiety, but the uncertainty surrounding Covid meant that people were reacting due to uncertainty rather than a compulsive need to avoid germs.  Germaphobia shares more in common with obsessive compulsive behavior, while the effects Covid had on anxieties reflected more similarly to generalized anxiety, or post traumatic stress in extreme cases.  While both OCD and PTSD are anxiety disorders, they can manifest in very different ways, and we just wanted to remove some common misconceptions about reactions to Covid and possible diagnoses people could give themselves or others.  Maybe germaphobia manifested in many people due to Covid, but this would widely be an extreme reaction to the stress of the pandemic, and could even be described as a symptom of post traumatic stress.  Without diving into armchair psychology too much, it would be incorrect to lump the anxieties surrounding Covid into a diagnosis of germaphobia.
