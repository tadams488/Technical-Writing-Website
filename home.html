<h4>Introduction to COVID-19</h4>
<p>In late 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus that causes
    the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), originated and began spreading around the globe.  By March 2020,
    many countries across the world had issued quarantine orders and mandated social distancing, closed
    their national borders, and banned most outbound travel in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.
    These closures and mandates persisted throughout the remainder of 2020 and the majority of 2021 and
    resulted in drastic changes in lifestyle for the majority of society over a 18 month period. Debilitating
    financial issues arose with the initial closures as many businesses closed, causing stocks to plummet in
    response to widespread panic and disruptions to the supply chain that persisted long after the inciting
    incident.  Schools and colleges worldwide also shut down completely and shifted to online instruction. 
    The disease itself spread fairly rapidly despite social distancing and increased hygiene, and the virus has 
    killed almost five million people worldwide as of today.  Simultaneously, the pandemic led to drastic declines 
    in mental health in many individuals, and helping to address the causes of the issues and how individuals can 
    improve their mental health should be made a priority in returning to normal.  This site will focus on the 
    specific reasons caused or exacerbated by the pandemic that people may be feeling more anxiety and depression, 
    potential solutions related to each issue and general mental health help, and plan to improve society&apos;s 
    response in future pandemics.</p>
