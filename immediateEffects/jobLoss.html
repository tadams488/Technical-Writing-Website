      ...the loss of business for months to a year was too much for many businesses to handle, causing them to permanently close.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an effort to slow down the spread of Covid, many countries began issuing stay-at-home orders and enforcing curfews, keeping people that weren’t providing an essential service from potentially spreading the virus in public.  The food and entertainment industries were among those hit hardest, where many restaurants were forced to close or shift to only takeout and online ordering, and movie theatres were widely forced to close and are only now starting to be used widely again.  Retail jobs, such as clothing, appliance, and other shops were almost all closed for being non-essential, meaning these workers were out of a job for an indeterminate amount of time.

      Many small businesses were also hit hard during this time, as the loss of business for months to a year was too much for many businesses to handle, causing them to permanently close.  Many office jobs were forced to go online if possible, but if in-person work was required for the job then many of these workers were furloughed or outright fired when the businesses were told to close.  Even businesses that remained open due to being essential, such as supermarkets, reduced the number of workers they had on payroll.  This is due to decreases in demand, since there just weren’t as many people using in-person services once these mandates became more common.  All of these effects resulted in many people either out of work or working in very different circumstances than they were hired in.

      (While) the less restrictive methods...showed a reduction in the number of cases, the more restrictive methods paradoxically showed an increase in the number of cases.  </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the more extreme of these measures, such as forced closures of businesses and mandatory stay-at-home orders, may have done more harm than good.  In an article by Bendavid et al., they investigated ten countries in their use of major and minor nonpharmaceutical methods in slowing the spread of Covid, and found that in none of the countries that implemented major methods did those methods actually help in slowing the spread of Covid.  While nonpharmaceutical methods in general did help, and specifically the less restrictive methods like guidelines and bans on large public gatherings showed a reduction in the number of cases, the more restrictive methods paradoxically showed an increase in the number of cases.  The researchers involved theorize that this may be due to the virus more easily spreading in areas of close contact, which would involve households, and that these methods overall are effective in reducing case numbers because any mandates lead to “anti-contagion behaviour changes, either directly through personal compliance with the interventions, or by providing a signal about disease risk, as communicated by policymakers,” <a href="../workscited.html#source4">(Bendavid et al., 2021, p.5)</a>.  As we find throughout our own research, many of the more extreme measures may have led to serious detriments, from domestic abuse to depression and suicide, so finding that these methods weren’t effective, and may have even helped spread Covid more is certainly disheartening.
