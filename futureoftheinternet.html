<h4>Future of the Internet</h4>

<p>The Internet would never have grown if everyone just consumed information and did not produce it.  For this to happen, there could be no central control of the World Wide Web, so that anyone who wanted to put information online could.  Imagine if there was only one server or one Internet browser, controlled by a person or group of people who decided what constituted the Web and who had access to it. </p>

<p>Beyond enabling people to contribute information to the <a href="glossary.html#link10">World Wide Web</a>, new technologies would have to be developed that would allow it to expand, and Berners-Lee hoped that more people would have a voice in deciding what new HTML and other related technological standards would be.  To this end, he started the World Wide Web Consortium, also known as the W3C, and this is still the most important organization for unifying the many parties that have a stake in the development of the Web.</p> 

<h6>HTML and Standardization</h6>
<p>While Berners-Lee invented HTML, HTML and other associated protocol languages are not owned by anyone.  They are standards that the W3C consortium
tries to get professionals from corporations and non-profit corporations to adopt for the technologies they will eventually design and manufacture, and they need to be updated from time to time.  For example, browsers only work if they use HTML as this is the basis of the Web, the <a href="glossary.html#link8">lingua franca</a> of Web sites, and when there is a problem with some aspects of HTML, the people who manufacture browsers need to suggest new ideas, perhaps propose new HTML tags that replace older ones that are ineffective, and then agree to compromise on some standards and then actually use these standards so the WWW works smoothly.</p>
 

 
<p>Berners-Lee uses the analogy of the international phone system to explain his reasons for standardization for the basic WWW infrastructure:  “The phone system defines what it has to, but then leaves how it is used up to the devices.  That’s what we needed for computers on the Web” (Berners-Lee and Fischetti 99).   The signals and voltages for phones are exactly the same everywhere, and with appropriate adapters, different companies can produce different end-of-the-line devices, such as phones and answering machines, that are all connected to the international phone system infrastructure. In the same way, technologies such as personal computers made by different manufacturers can be used to connect to and work on the Internet.</p>
